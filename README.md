# VPN Benchmark Tooling

This repository creates a network of VMs on the google cloud with opentofu, 
installs clan on every machine and then performs benchmarks for different VPNs.

## Setup

Let's get your development environment up and running:

1. **Install Nix Package Manager**:

      - You can install the Nix package manager by either [downloading the Nix installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer/releases) or running this command:
        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
        ```

2. **Install direnv**:

      - To automatically setup a devshell on entering the directory
        ```bash
        nix profile install nixpkgs#nix-direnv-flakes nixpkgs#direnv
        ```

3. **Add direnv to your shell**:

      - Direnv needs to [hook into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) to work.
        You can do this by executing following command. The example below will setup direnv for `zsh` and `bash`

      ```bash
      echo 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc && echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc && eval "$SHELL"
      ```

4. **Setup the gcloud cli**

For terraform to be able to access the google cloud api you need to install the `google-cloud-sdk` and execute:
```bash
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```
