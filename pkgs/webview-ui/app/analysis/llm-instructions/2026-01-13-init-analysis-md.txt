❯ Create an overview.md for every analysis.md file, that has a new          
  structuture, that should give people all the answers they need to         
  evaluate if the VPN is useful for them or not.                            
  Spawn an agent for every analysis.md file.                                
  For every analysis file, there is the VPNs source code checked out next   
  to it.                                                                    
  If the analysis.md file does not have enough information to answer the    
  checklist, read up in the source code.                                    
                                                                            
  If you don't now an answer, mark it as DON'T KNOW.                        
                                                                            
  also instead of creating an overview.md file for both tailscale and       
  headscale, please just create one for both.                               
                                                                            
  The structure should look like follows:

  Each overview includes:
  - Architecture description and key components
  - Protocol details with transport/IP/layer mode checklists
  - Encryption layer analysis with key exchange and cipher checklists
  - Performance analysis with threading and optimization checklists
  - Security vulnerabilities and feature checklists
  - NAT traversal capabilities
  - Local routing and LAN discovery
  - Central point of failure analysis
  - Authentication methods
  - Platform support

  The agents consulted both the analysis files and source code to fill in the checklists accurately with [x] for supported and [ ] for unsupported features.

❯ can you now create one markdown feature matrix over all vpn overview.md   
  files please?

      1 # Mesh VPN Feature Matrix
      2 A comprehensive comparison of mesh VPN solutions across protocol,
         encryption, performance, security, NAT traversal, routing, resil
        ience, authentication, and platform support features.

     … +352 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Created the feature matrix at /home/lhebendanz/Projects/meshvpns/feature_matrix.md.

  The matrix includes:

  10 main sections with 131 total features compared across 9 VPN solutions:

  1. Protocol Features - Transport, IP support, network layer modes, advanced features
  2. Encryption - Key exchange, symmetric encryption, protocol security
  3. Performance - Threading, packet I/O, UDP offload, buffer management, userspace TCP, MTU, peer management
  4. Security - Network security, identity/auth, implementation safety
  5. NAT Traversal - Discovery, port mapping, hole punching, fallback
  6. Local Routing - LAN discovery, optimization, routing features
  7. Resilience - Offline operation, redundancy
  8. Authentication - Enrollment methods, authorization, identity
  9. Platform Support - Desktop/server, mobile, implementation details

  Summary statistics showing total feature counts:
  - Tailscale: 101/131 (highest)
  - ZeroTier: 81/131
  - Nebula: 71/131
  - Tinc: 65/131
  - EasyTier: 62/131
  - Hyprspace: 61/131
  - VpnCloud: 48/131
  - Yggdrasil: 45/131
  - Mycelium: 41/131

  Plus key takeaways for different use cases (performance, NAT traversal, Layer 2/bridging, decentralization, enterprise features, simplicity, and memory safety).

❯ Please look into how in my webui for VPN benchmarks here:                 
  /home/lhebendanz/Projects/vpn-benchmark-suite/pkgs/webview-ui. For every  
  VPN there is an "Overview" tab. Please read the EasyTier_overview.md and  
  implement the overview tab for easytier first based on the information    
  contained.
